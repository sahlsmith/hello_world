# hello_world
My first hit hub repository
ive been poking at computers for many years (fortran-4, punch cards, ibm360s, etc.) i feel its about time to learn how to use today's tools to write, test and deliver some beautiful code. continuous integration, continuous delivery, and contiuous learning.
i live in Tacoma,WA and occasionally dog-sit for Harley, a very clever Springer Spaniel who watches over ROOMBA while i'm at work
